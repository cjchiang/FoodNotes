        This app was made by BCIT CST students for their COMP 2910 project. The purpose for creating this app is to help address food waste problems by helping users identify the amount of potential savings from tracking all the food bits thrown out.

                <p>Ron goes shopping at CostCo. He buys 10 apples, but a bug appends them to firebase wrong and now Ron has 10 apples, each for the price of 10 apples. </p>
