      <h3>What is Food Notes?</h3>
      <p class="flow-text">
        FoodNotes is a time-based food-waste-management app that allows users
        to keep track of how much of their food isn't eaten, and records that as money.
        All leftover or unused food is counted towards a wasted total amount.
        Previous cycles are also logged, so users can keep tabs on their waste, and their wallet.
